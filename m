Current state of the driver for the ADP5588/87 only allows partial
I/O to be used as GPIO. This support was previously present as a
separate gpio driver, which was dropped with the commit
5ddc896088b0 ("gpio: gpio-adp5588: drop the driver") since the
functionality was deemed to have been merged with adp5588-keys.

This series of patches re-enables this support by allowing the driver to 
relax the requirement for registering a keymap and enable pure GPIO 
operation. 

Changelog
==========

V2: 
	-  Changed gpio_only from a local variable to a member of struct
	adp5588_kpad
	-  Removed condition from adp5588_probe() to skip adp5588_fw_parse() if 
	gpio-only specified. adp558_fw_parse() now handles and returns
	0 if gpio-only has been specified.
	-  Added a check in adp5588_fw_parse() to make sure keypad 
	properties(keypad,num-columns and keypad,num-rows) were not defined when 
	gpio-only specified

V3:
	-  Moved device_property_present() for reading "gpio-only" into 
	adp558_fw_parse()
	-  Added print statements in case of error

V4:
	- Added dt-bindings patch

V5:
	- Removed extra property "gpio-only", now pure gpio mode is
	  detected via the adbsence of keypad specific properties.
	- Added dependencies for keypad properties to preserve
	  the original requirements in case a pure gpio mode is not
	  being used.
	- Added additional description for why the "interrupts" property
	  was made optional
	- Rebased current work based on https://lore.kernel.org/linux-input/ZoLt_qBCQS-tG8Ar@google.com/

Changes in v8:
	- Fixed indentation in document example (removed extra spaces)
- Link to v7: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20240704-adp5588_gpio_support-v7-0-e34eb7eba5ab@analog.com

Changes in v7:
	- Fixed commit subject for transported patch 
	- Driver now does not setup gpio_irq_chip if 
	  interrupt has not been provided
	- Fixed indentation for dtbinding example
- Link to v6: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20240704-adp5588_gpio_support-v6-0-cb65514d714b@analog.com

Changes in v6:
	- Restored functionality to register interrupts in GPIO
	  mode(i.e, these are optional but not exclusive to keypad mode
	  since even in pure gpio mode, they can be used as inputs via 
	  gpio-keys)
	- Updated dt-bindings such that each keypad property depends on
	  the others. Interrupts, although optional are now required by 
	  keypad mode but are not limited to it.
