panfrost_reset() soft-stops the slots and waits for them to go idle by
polling JOB_INT_JS_STATE. That register is not live: it is a snapshot of
the slot states taken when JOB_INT_CLEAR was last written (the Arm
driver documents it as "status==active and _next == busy snapshot from
last JOB_IRQ_CLEAR"). For a job that was started into an idle slot, the
usual case for an OpenCL queue that submits one kernel at a time, it
still shows the slot idle, and the wait ends at once while the job is
still running.

The GPU reset that follows hides this, since it kills the job anyway.
Without a reset it does not: with the soft-stopped job resumed instead
(next patch) and this wait, the job was removed from pfdev->jobs[] and
resubmitted while its first run was still stopping. When that first run
reported DONE, the handler signalled the resubmission's fence, the job
manager started the resubmission from _NEXT, and its completion found
no job on the slot (Mali-G31, OpenCL CTS Integer Ops):

  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000000000f8
  pc : panfrost_dequeue_job+0x2c/0xd8 [panfrost]
  lr : panfrost_jm_handle_irqs+0x268/0x570 [panfrost]

Wait on the live JS_STATUS registers instead: a slot is busy while it
reads ACTIVE, and every slot has to be idle before the queues are
touched, so that the pending DONE or STOPPED interrupt is handled first.
And make panfrost_dequeue_job() return NULL for a slot without a job:
every caller copes with a NULL, so a stray event is a warning rather
than an Oops.
