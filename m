From: Josef Bacik <josef@toxicpanda.com>

Swap-ins from SWP_SYNCHRONOUS_IO devices such as zram are no longer
counted in PSI memory pressure or in the swapin and thrashing delays of
delay accounting.  Refaults of the workingset from zram, the main input
to userspace OOM handlers like lmkd and systemd-oomd on zram systems,
become invisible in /proc/pressure/memory.

swap_read_folio() opens the accounting window with
psi_memstall_enter() and delayacct_swapin_start() and, per its comment,
means to count the submission time.  For synchronous devices the
submission is the entire read: swap_bdev_submit_read() does
submit_bio_wait() and completes the folio.  Since reads are batched in
a swap_iocb, swap_read_folio() only queues the folio with
swap_add_folio(), and the bio is submitted later by swap_read_submit()
in the caller, e.g. swapin_sync(), after the window has been closed.
By then the folio is uptodate and unlocked, so the fault does not wait
on the folio lock either and the read time is not counted anywhere.

Found by code inspection; not reproduced.

Fix by submitting synchronous reads from within swap_read_folio(), as
was done before the batching, rather than from the caller.  This gives
up batching of readahead for synchronous devices, which do their I/O
inline anyway, in exchange for keeping the accounting simple and in one
place.
