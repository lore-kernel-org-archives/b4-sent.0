SRRCTL.BSIZEPKT has a granularity of 1 KiB. For AF_XDP zero-copy rings,
igb_setup_srrctl() programs xsk_pool_get_rx_frame_size(), which is
rounded down. With 2 KiB UMEM chunks and the default headroom this is
1792 bytes, so the hardware buffer becomes 1 KiB and a full-size frame
spans two Rx buffers. igb_clean_rx_irq_zc() handles every descriptor as
a complete frame, so the AF_XDP socket gets such a frame as two
packets, the second one without headers. With Rx timestamping enabled,
the timestamp header is also stripped from the second buffer, and a
short final buffer makes the size wrap.

Program the same buffer size as for the other rings, 2 KiB or 3 KiB.
This depends on "igb: do not let XDP frames span more than one Rx
buffer": the receive length limit set there while XDP is attached keeps
the hardware from writing more than the frame plus the timestamp header
into the larger buffer. Without it, the hardware can write past the XSK
frame.

Refuse an XSK pool whose frame size cannot hold that, and an MTU change
that would no longer fit a bound pool, also while no XDP program is
attached. The current MTU is checked rather than the largest XDP MTU,
as igb allows XDP up to MTU 3030 and that would rule out 2 KiB chunks.
With VFs, the PF keeps a single Tx queue, and one Rx queue on i350 or
two on 82576. A pool bound to a queue above that would lose its Rx
queue, which the MTU check then no longer sees, or its Tx queue, which
breaks the socket. The core refuses ethtool -L in that case (with
-EINVAL). Likewise, refuse to enable VFs with -EBUSY while an XSK pool
is bound to a queue the PF would lose. On that error, igb_enable_sriov()
also restores the DMA coalescing flag it cleared. The MAC filter
entries it reserved for the VFs before the check stay reserved until
the next reset.

A queue can also be hidden without such a request, for example when the
driver falls back from MSI-X to MSI and keeps one queue. The MTU check
does not see a pool on that queue, so igb_xsk_pool() checks the frame
size again when the ring is set up, and does not use zero-copy if the
frame does not fit. The socket then receives through the copy path,
and its Tx wakeup fails with EINVAL, until the ring is set up again
with an MTU that fits. This path was not tested.

This is the igb counterpart of the igc XSK buffer change.

Tested on an I350 with xdpsock from bpf-examples in rxdrop zero-copy
mode on one queue, Rx timestamping on and 1514-byte frames from the
peer. With 2 KiB chunks, the receive descriptors went from about two
per frame to one per frame; 98-byte frames and 4 KiB chunks were one
per frame with and without this patch. At MTU 3000, 4 KiB chunks
receive 3014-byte frames in one buffer. A 2 KiB chunk pool at MTU 3000
was refused by the new check on the 6.14.9 test kernel; current kernels
already refuse it in xp_assign_dev(). There, with 2 KiB chunks and the
default headroom, the new check refuses MTU 1751 to 1766, which the core
accepts.

On 7.3.1, with xdpsock bound to queue 1 of an I350, enabling two VFs is
now refused with EBUSY and the socket keeps its queue; with the socket on
queue 0, which the PF keeps, the VFs are enabled. The 82576 case, with
two Rx queues and one Tx queue for the PF, was checked with the driver
built so that the I350 keeps two Rx queues with VFs: with the socket on
queue 1, the VF enable is refused as well. Only the refusal was checked.
