This series adds a power supply driver for the Apple SMC found on
Apple Silicon devices. This allows the kernel to report AC status,
battery charging status, and power metrics, and modify the charging
behaviour.

The first patch adds the driver itself, and the second patch wires it
up to the MFD core.

The driver is based on an original out-of-tree implementation by
Hector Martin. It has been refactored by myself for upstream inclusion,
including support for newer SMC firmwares, devices without batteries,
dynamic property detection and improved state management, among other
things.

This series is based ontop of the current linux-next at time of writing,
the exact commit hash is listed below.

Tested on: Apple M3 (MacBook Air, J613)
