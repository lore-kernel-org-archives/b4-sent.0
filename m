Hi Marc,

as there were different patches flying arround to fix CAN_BCM issues and
AI assisted stuff pop's up again and again, I've created this collection
to be applied.

The patch series fixes ALL issues reported by ALL kind of AI bots involved
and the fixes were assisted by claude code and later rephrased and shortened
by myself.

Inserted a new patch 9 that addresses a late sashiko-bot report fixing some
stale rx/tx ops behaviour after device removal.

So the potential new AI reports on this patch set report problems that are
solved later in the series. This can not be resolved.

Best regards,
Oliver
