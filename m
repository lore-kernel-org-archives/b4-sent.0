Asynchronous SCMI commands are completed by a delayed response. The RX
path signals the response with complete(xfer->async_done). Unlike
xfer->done, xfer->async_done is a pointer to a completion owned by
whoever is waiting for the delayed response, and it stays valid only for
as long as that waiter is still waiting.  In do_xfer_with_response() it
is a DECLARE_COMPLETION_ONSTACK() in the caller's stack frame.

Nothing serialises the RX path against a waiter that gives up on a
timeout. scmi_msg_response_validate() does read xfer->async_done
under xfer->lock, and documents that as a requirement, but the lock is
dropped again before scmi_handle_response() dereferences the pointer,
and neither the arming nor the disarming side takes it at all. So a
delayed response arriving just as the wait times out can be signalled
on a completion that is already gone:

  waiter                                RX path (IRQ context)
  ------                                ---------------------
  do_xfer_with_response():
    xfer->async_done = &async_response
    do_xfer(xfer)
    wait_for_completion_timeout(xfer->async_done, tmo)
    /* returns 0, gives up */
                                        /* response receive interrupt */
                                        scmi_handle_response():
                                          scmi_xfer_command_acquire()
                                            lock xfer->lock
                                            validate: async_done != NULL
                                            unlock xfer->lock
    xfer->async_done = NULL
    return -ETIMEDOUT
    /* async_response goes out of scope */
                                          complete(xfer->async_done)

That last complete() has two possible bad outcomes: it either dereferences
the NULL just stored by the waiter or - if that store is not yet visible
on the RX CPU - it takes a lock and writes to a stack frame that the
waiter maybe has already returned from.

Fix this by making xfer->lock cover xfer->async_done end-to-end. Add
helpers to arm and disarm it under the lock, use them on both the regular
and the raw paths, and have the RX path read and signal the completion
under that same lock. A waiter that is timing out then either completes
its disarm before the RX path looks, in which case the delayed response is
dropped, or blocks in the disarm until the RX path is done with the
completion, in which case the completion is still alive.

Account for the dropped case with a new "delayed_response_dropped"
debugfs counter to make it visible if this ever happens.
