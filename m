This patch rewrites pmc.txt into YAML format. Descriptive texts are
expanded or shortened in a few places to better fit today's conventions.

The list of compatible strings (and combinations of them) is based on
existing device trees in arch/powerpc as well as compatible strings
already mentioned in the plain-text version of the binding.

One thing I didn't handle are soc-clk@... nodes as seen in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/powerpc/fsl/pmc.yaml.

Changes in v2:
- Rebase on v6.15-rc1
- Link to v1: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250315-fslpmc-yaml-v1-1-10ba354a85c2@posteo.net
---

Note: The examples include a consumer (sata@19000), to demonstrate how
sleep specifiers work. I've heard that "unrelated" nodes in examples are
generally discouraged, but I'm not sure if it's better to keep it or to
drop it in this example.

-Properties:
-- compatible: "fsl,<chip>-pmc".
-
-  "fsl,mpc8349-pmc" should be listed for any chip whose PMC is
-  compatible.  "fsl,mpc8313-pmc" should also be listed for any chip
-  whose PMC is compatible, and implies deep-sleep capability.
-
-  "fsl,mpc8548-pmc" should be listed for any chip whose PMC is
-  compatible.  "fsl,mpc8536-pmc" should also be listed for any chip

-
-  "fsl,mpc8641d-pmc" should be listed for any chip whose PMC is
-  compatible; all statements below that apply to "fsl,mpc8548-pmc" also
-  apply to "fsl,mpc8641d-pmc".
-
-  Compatibility does not include bit assignments in SCCR/PMCDR/DEVDISR; these
-  bit assignments are indicated via the sleep specifier in each device's
-  sleep property.
-
-- reg: For devices compatible with "fsl,mpc8349-pmc", the first resource
-  is the PMC block, and the second resource is the Clock Configuration
-  block.
-
-  For devices compatible with "fsl,mpc8548-pmc", the first resource
-  is a 32-byte block beginning with DEVDISR.
-
-- interrupts: For "fsl,mpc8349-pmc"-compatible devices, the first
-  resource is the PMC block interrupt.
-
-- fsl,mpc8313-wakeup-timer: For "fsl,mpc8313-pmc"-compatible devices,
-  this is a phandle to an "fsl,gtm" node on which timer 4 can be used as
-  a wakeup source from deep sleep.
-
-Sleep specifiers:
-
-  fsl,mpc8349-pmc: Sleep specifiers consist of one cell.  For each bit
-  that is set in the cell, the corresponding bit in SCCR will be saved
-  and cleared on suspend, and restored on resume.  This sleep controller
-  supports disabling and resuming devices at any time.
-
-  fsl,mpc8536-pmc: Sleep specifiers consist of three cells, the third of
-  which will be ORed into PMCDR upon suspend, and cleared from PMCDR
-  upon resume.  The first two cells are as described for fsl,mpc8578-pmc.
-  This sleep controller only supports disabling devices during system
-  sleep, or permanently.
-
-  fsl,mpc8548-pmc: Sleep specifiers consist of one or two cells, the
-  first of which will be ORed into DEVDISR (and the second into
-  DEVDISR2, if present -- this cell should be zero or absent if the
-  hardware does not have DEVDISR2) upon a request for permanent device
-  disabling.  This sleep controller does not support configuring devices
-  to disable during system sleep (unless supported by another compatible
-  match), or dynamically.

+description: |
+  The Power Management Controller in several MPC8xxx SoCs helps save power by
+  controlling chip-wide low-power states as well as peripheral clock gating.
+
+  Sleep of peripheral devices is configured by the `sleep` property, for
+  example `sleep = <&pmc 0x00000030>`. Any cells after the &pmc phandle are
+  called a sleep specifier.
+
+  For "fsl,mpc8349-pmc", sleep specifiers consist of one cell.  For each bit that
+  is set in the cell, the corresponding bit in SCCR will be saved and cleared
+  on suspend, and restored on resume.  This sleep controller supports disabling
+  and resuming devices at any time.
+
+  For "fsl,mpc8536-pmc", sleep specifiers consist of three cells, the third of
+  which will be ORed into PMCDR upon suspend, and cleared from PMCDR upon
+  resume.  The first two cells are as described for fsl,mpc8548-pmc.  This
+  sleep controller only supports disabling devices during system sleep, or
+  permanently.
+
+  For "fsl,mpc8548-pmc" or "fsl,mpc8641d-pmc", Sleep specifiers consist of one
+  or two cells, the first of which will be ORed into DEVDISR (and the second
+  into DEVDISR2, if present -- this cell should be zero or absent if the
+  hardware does not have DEVDISR2) upon a request for permanent device
+  disabling.  This sleep controller does not support configuring devices to
+  disable during system sleep (unless supported by another compatible match),
+  or dynamically.
