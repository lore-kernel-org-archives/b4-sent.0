ath12k_mac_fill_reg_tpc_info() takes a non-zero
reg_tpc_info.num_pwr_levels to mean that a TPE element was parsed, and
then limits every power level by reg_tpc_info.tpe[]. But it also stores
the number of levels it filled in that same field.

An AP vdev never parses a TPE element. Its first vdev start finds the
field zero and fills the levels from the regulatory rules; every later
start or restart of the vdev, such as a channel switch, finds the count
of the last fill there, takes the "TPE received" branch with the level
count of the old width, and limits every level by tpe[], which is all
zeroes. WMI_VDEV_SET_TPC_POWER_CMDID then carries a limit of 0 dBm, and
the AP transmits at that until the interface is removed and added
again. A station whose AP sent no TPE element for its power type goes
the same way on its next vdev start.

On a 6 GHz AP, after a channel switch from channel 149 to 165 at
80 MHz, or one that only changes the width (80 to 320 MHz, or back),
iw reports "txpower 0.00 dBm", tpc_stats shows "power limit-0" where it
showed 48 before the switch, and a station next to the AP hears it
15 dB lower.

Keep whether a TPE element was parsed in a flag of its own, set by
ath12k_mac_parse_tx_pwr_env(), and test that instead. With the change
the power is the same before and after seven channel switches, three of
them width changes.

The change and this message were written with Claude, an AI coding
assistant.

Found on an Arista C-460 (IPQ9574 with three QCN9274 hw2.0) running
OpenWrt: its 6 GHz AP went to 0 dBm after every channel switch, and
stayed there until the interface was taken down and brought up again.
The cause was found by reading the code.

Tested on that board with Linux 6.18 and ath12k from backports 7.2,
carrying the same change: without it four of four channel switches
left "txpower 0.00 dBm"; with it seven of seven kept the power. The
code in ath-next is the same there. On ath-next the patch is
compile-tested only.
